# Props

In order to work properly, the Combobox require some props:

## searchTerm

`string`  
**required**  
The `searchTerm` prop is the text rendered on the dropdown input. 
The expected implementation requires a state (of type string) to be passed as searchTerm and then use it to fetch the options

## onChangeSearchTerm

`(string) => void`  
**required**  
This is the dispatch function to update the searchTerm

## value

`Option | null`
**required**  
The selected value of the dropdown.

## onChangeSearchTerm

`(Option | null) => void`
**required**  
The function to select value of the dropdown.

## options

`Option[]`  
**required**  
An array of options to be shown in the dropdown. It can have any object type. Just remember to specify the key property.

## optionKey

`keyof Option`  
**required**  
The key property of the option object. It's used to index each item. It's also the property used as label for the dropdown list if no `optionLabel` or `customOptionLabel` is provided.

## optionLabel

`keyof Option`  
The property of the option object to be used as a label in the dropdown.

## customOptionLabel
`(Option) => JSX.Element`  

When you want to render more than the property value in the dropdown item. This function returns a JSX.Element. It's great for condition rendering and custom elements.

## label
`string`  

The text to be shown as a placeholder of the closed dropdown.

## placeholder
`string`  

The text to be shown as the placeholder of the dropdown input

## debounce
`number`  

The number in miliseconds for the onChangeSearchTerm to take effect. Ideal for when fetching data on key down.
