# UI Component Library

This component library is built using React + Vite
It contains the components I (re)use the most in personal projects

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Installation

- Clone the repo and then install the dependencies with `npm install`
- You can check the working components with Storybook by running `npm run storybook`
